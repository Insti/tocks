Tock Tracker!

A tock is like a pomodoro but 45 minutes instead of 25.

Contest Rules:
 - each hour that >1 of us does a tock we each put $2 in the pot
 - if you don't finish in 45 minutes you forfeit your ante and get nothing
 - of those remaining, whoever takes *longest* to finish gets the pot
   (future idea: split the pot proportionally to how long each person took)
 - if no one finished in 45 minutes, the pot rolls over for next time
 - you have to mark the tock as :fail if you get tagtime-pinged while off task

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Copy settings.pl.template to settings.pl and mutatis mutandis
2. Create a symlink, eg: ln -s prj/tocks/settings.pl ~/.tocksrc
3. Put something like this in your crontab:
     00 * * * * $HOME/prj/tocks/launch.pl
     59 8 * * * rm -f $HOME/prj/tocks/.tocklock

     # do crontab <crontab filename> after editting the file
     # template:  minute hour day month day-of-week  command
     #
     # Set first field to '*' for every minute (handy for debugging)
     # or to 00 to launch every hour on the hour

3b. Or, if you want to start tocks manually, you may need to edit out the line 
    that starts something like $ENV{DISPLAY} = ":0.0"; 
    Don't know what the hell that crap is about; only an issue for bsoule.
