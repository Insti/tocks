Chrock Tracker!

A chrock is like a pomodoro but 45 minutes instead of 20.

Contest Rules:
 - each hour that >1 of us does a chrock we each put $2 in the pot
 - if you don't finish in 45 minutes you forfeit your ante and get nothing
 - of those remaining, whoever takes *longest* to finish gets the pot
   (future idea: split the pot proportionally to how long each person took)
 - if no one finished in 45 minutes, the pot rolls over for next time
 - you have to mark the chrock as :fail if you get tagtime-pinged while off task
